    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial SMMA Calculation**: The first value of the SMMA is simply a Simple Moving Average (SMA) over a specified period. For example, if you're using a 10-period SMMA, the first value would be the average of the first 10 data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subsequent SMMA Calculations**: For subsequent values, the SMMA formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{SMMA}_i = \\frac{(n-1) \\cdot \\text{SMMA}_{i-1} + \\text{Close}_i}{n}\n",

    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(\\text{SMMA}_i\\) is the current period's SMMA.\n",
    "- \\(\\text{SMMA}_{i-1}\\) is the previous period's SMMA.\n",
    "- \\(\\text{Close}_i\\) is the current period's closing price.\n",
    "- \\(n\\) is the smoothing period.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Day 4: 13\n",
    "- Day 5: 14\n",
    "- Day 6: 15\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Calculate the initial SMA (first SMMA value)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{SMA}_5 = \\frac{10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14}{5} = 12\n",

    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{SMMA}_6 = \\frac{(5-1) \\cdot 12 + 15}{5} = \\frac{48 + 15}{5} = 12.6\n",
